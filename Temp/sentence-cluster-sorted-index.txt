 I am a registered you know Republican in Kansas she tells Nancy$62
 I can t tell how this one is going to go said Mike Russell a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee$62
 Marilyn Rymer a neurologist in Kansas City Mo would routinely delete even as a registered Democrat$62
 On the other side Republican consultants are telling their candidates to stress Clinton s misdeeds and stay away from talk of impeachment$62
 They tell me Oh we re going to do very well Mr$62
 And oh the speaker wanted a donation of to to help our efforts according to a transcript of a similar chat with another doctor to elect a bigger Republican majority in the House of Representatives$63
 Is this congressman Gingrich s office that I m talking to the doctor asks$63
 May I help you A doctor in Kansas City Mo who is a registered Republican and who declined to be named dialed the Gingrich number left on answering machines and secretly recorded the ensuing discussion which is legal in Missouri$63
 Rymer and Turecki is the message left with secretaries and answering machines invoking Gingrich s office and proposing the award$63
 This is the speaker s office That I m talking to says the doctor double checking$63
 He is of Lithuanian descent has a pocket of Lithuanians in his hometown of Collinsville and wants to try to highlight his support for the Baltic states past efforts against Soviet repression$64
 In one deft sentence he acknowledged his personal pain while claiming credit for the country s economic strength making a compact appeal for both sympathy and support in an appearance earlier in the day in Cleveland$64
 The chickens are from Mississippi$64
 They want agriculture export credits to buy chickens for Russia which has bought the chickens but cannot pay for them$64
 Carson to contain the Lewinsky debacle and their opponents attempts to capitalize on it offer important clues suggesting how Clinton s problems are influencing the conduct of races around the country$65
 Clinton has stopped apologizing for his conduct with Monica Lewinsky but he has taken to making glancing at times humble references to it before moving on to attack the Republican Congress as indifferent to Americans needs$65
 It would be very premature for me to suggest any course of action without it being referred$65
 That argument of course would also insulate Clinton from any blame for depressing the Democratic vote$65
 Alarmed that the Democrats will lose Senate seats in California Illinois Wisconsin Nevada and South Carolina Rivera s union concluded that it was worth backing Schumer$66
 By contrast Democrats in South Carolina Georgia and Nevada would be less likely to oppose Clinton s impeachment$66
 Corrine Brown of Florida Vic Snyder of Arkansas Lois Capps and Ellen Tauscher of California Martin Frost of Texas Melvin Watt of North Carolina John LaFalce of New York and Sander Levin of Michigan$66
 That kind of Democratic strategy might emerge in California New York Illinois Wisconsin Washington and perhaps Arkansas$66
 This is an issue where there is a huge disconnect between the elites and the public said Fred Yang a Democratic consultant with clients in Wisconsin and the Carolinas$66
 He is right now aggressively pushing legislation to cut taxes by as much as half and he s also interested in legislation to cut capital gains to a single rate of percent To assure passage of the legislation the speaker wants to increase his Republican majority she says adding To help us do that the speaker is pulling together a group of individuals such as yourself and is inviting you to be an honorary chairman on his advisory council Nancy continues There will be correspondence with the speaker such as conference calls$67
 Or maybe surveys or questionnaires Later Nancy says As a member of his committee you would be receiving from the speaker our national leadership award which is really quite an honor$67
 Probably if I were to do something it would be to go through my own representative Then the doctor tries to ascertain where Nancy is located$67
 The speaker s office says Nancy$67
 Uh huh Nancy replies$67
 We were asked to contact you on behalf of the speaker says a woman who picked up the call and identified herself as Nancy$67
 Carson is that when asked in separate interviews whether they would want Clinton to campaign in their districts both said it would be impossible at this late date for the White House to schedule a visit$68
 Here in North Carolina s th Congressional District Price acknowledging that his own polls showed him in a tight race said This is a swing district that is sensitive to any tide or trend$68
 In addition the district was redrawn last year to include a large Durham section where voters do not know him well$68
 Price is a centrist who has represented this high tech district in North Carolina for all but of the last years a political scientist who has taught at Duke and Yale$68
 They did nothing to fix the buildings they did nothing for technology and the urban school districts Ms$68

 D Amato$69
 Look I m not going to make any comment with respect to that subject matter D Amato responded$69
 Republicans certainly aren t going to let that happen D Amato responded to questions about Clinton with the language that Republican consultants have been suggesting to their candidates$69
 Schumer D NY and thereby risked D Amato s wrath$69
 When and if that matter comes to the Senate I will decide on the facts that are presented to me at that time D Amato said$69
 Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan it has been very close to the Clinton administration has many Democrats on its board and receives much of its money from Democratic contributors$7
 Although the Human Rights Campaign is bipartisan it has been very close to the Clinton administration has many Democrats on its board and receives much of its money from Democratic contributors$7
 But there is clearly a large number of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing D Amato will permanently damage the group particularly among women$7
 But there is clearly a large number of Human Rights Campaign contributors and board members who strongly feel that endorsing D Amato will permanently damage the group particularly among women$7
 As a result the Monica Lewinsky matter has suddenly injected a new disruptive force into the Senate contests$70
 Perhaps the best example of an attempt to force a vote for political advantage is a measure that would require minors to notify their parents if they are seeking contraceptives from federally funded family planning clinics$70
 The Senate does not plan to take it up and Clinton would almost certainly veto it$70
 The White House might think from the overall public numbers that maybe they would like to make this a referendum election said Ed Goeas a Republican pollster who is working in Senate races this year$70
 The last thing the party wants is to turn the Senate elections into a referendum on whether Clinton should be forced from office$70
 And while publicly these Democrats express confidence that the scandal will have little impact on them their campaigns are preparing for the worst by placing greater emphasis than ever on behind the efforts to prod their core constituencies to vote$71
 But the reporters who had gathered there showed little interest in the shiny train car at the senator s back$71
 Democrats have little influence in the Republican controlled Congress$71
 It passed the House by a vote of but has almost no chance of becoming law$71
 Most of these matters have little chance of finding their way into law but members hope to turn them to their advantage on Election Day$71
 For a long time politicians assumed that dispirited Democrats would stay home as a rebuke to Clinton just as many Republicans did in November three months after President Richard M$72
 It s not that we don t know and that the politicians don t know where the general public stands on impeachment$72
 Many Democrats are straddling a line that seems to shift a bit with every new scandal related disclosure they do not want to appear close to a president whose conduct embarrasses them and yet sensing the possibility of a public backlash against Republicans they are weighing their words carefully and are wary of hopping on any impeachment bandwagon$72
 The problem is that we don t know where the electorate stands on impeachment And asking voters to think ahead to an impeachment proceeding as they cast their ballots in a Senate race is in the words of Stuart Stevens a Republican consultant a double bank shot Such strategies he said tend to work only with a small number of single minded or sophisticated voters$72
 The sponsors of these measures now have the added advantage of the impeachment inquiry which has been preoccupying Congress the news media and the public and giving them cover to move their pet causes quietly into the gigantic omnibus package that Congress will eventually present to Clinton for signing$72
 After thanking the gathered donors for the very kind personal things they had said to him the president declared If I had to do it all over again every day I would do it in a heartbeat to see America where it is today as compared to six years ago As the applause died away Clinton continued I want you to understand too that we all have to live with the consequences of our mistakes in life He added with a chuckle Most of us don t have to live with it in quite such a public way$73
 If Democrats try to turn the image of Clinton in the dock to their advantage it would be in states with a Democratic edge or with sizable numbers of black voters who overwhelmingly support the president$73
 In a live telecast of the hearings he said the president deserved a lesser punishment such as censure or reprimand$73
 Lovin touchin squeezin it read the words superimposed on a cartoon of the president with his arm over Ms$73
In a cocoon of loyal and wealthy supporters President Clinton said Friday that he must live with the consequences of his mistakes although he contended that Democrats should take pride in the achievements of his presidency and take heart from its possibilities$73
 For labor leaders like Rivera the notion of a strong Republican majority is a nightmare$74
 Labor leaders say they fear that with a filibuster proof Republican majority the Senate would push through anti union legislation like recently defeated Republican proposals to curb labor s political spending and cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board$74
 Rivera president of the largest union in New York City praised D Amato for persuading Trent Lott the Senate majority leader to support legislation that financed health coverage for hundreds of thousands of uninsured children$74
 Rivera s union and the teachers union have labor s strongest political operations in New York$74
 The endorsement is risky labor leaders acknowledge because angering this powerful senator could make him far less responsive to labor s needs when unions turn to him for help in the future if he is re elected$74
 We are worried about legislation that will not allow the labor movement to survive into the next century Rivera said$74
It was a surprising scene three months ago when Dennis Rivera one of New York City s most left leaning labor leaders was singing the praises of Sen$74
 At a coffee with voters in a wealthy enclave of Raleigh the other night Roberg opened his remarks by asserting that Clinton had lost the moral authority to lead Yet none of those assembled asked him about the scandal they were more concerned about the state s plans to build a highway near their neighborhood$75
 But the Price campaign also has a weapon it is holding in reserve in the event Roberg appears to be riding the Clinton scandal to advantage the incumbent s advisers say they would not be timid about running commercials underscoring that he earned a divinity degree before getting his doctorate in political science$75
 Carson in Indiana s th Congressional District is taking a more subtle approach rather than mention the scandal directly he notes as often as he can that Julia votes with Clinton almost percent of the time Asked why he was not much raising the scandal directly Hofmeister said Don t murder somebody when they re in the process of committing suicide$75
 In a reflection of the uncertainty that the Clinton scandal has cast even among Republicans the challengers in the Price and Carson districts both are political novices seeking office for the first time have differing strategies Tom Roberg a computer executive in Raleigh who is taking on Price has broadcast a television commercial exploiting the scandal$75
 Rather than engage Roberg over the Clinton scandal Price has begun broadcasting a television commercial that emphasizes his central issue education$75
 The congressman s advisers say they intentionally produced an advertisement that appears decidedly nonpolitical it features school children in a play in an effort to break through the television clutter about the scandal$75
 And Price I don t think that would be such a good idea he said$76
 But party officials who opened this election year with high hopes of recapturing the House are beginning to worry that Democratic incumbents like Price and Mrs$76
 Determined not to be a midterm casualty of Clinton once again Price says he is waging the most vigorous get out the vote ground campaign of his career$76
 It s something you think about a lot in connection with the president s troubles The efforts of Price and Mrs$76
 There would be a danger if we went overboard The best evidence of the discomfort of both Price and Mrs$76
 This is not the time to be silent Price$76
 We d like to see them go on with the people s business Back here in the th District Price has some reasons to be worried$76
 But this isn t going to be investigated because it s members of Congress who are doing it Todd Harris a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee said that he had not heard of any complaints and that there was no intent to deceive$77
 Every conceivable objection is scripted with a powerful rebuttal Besides telemarketing for businesses said Jamie Blair a supervisor at the center we specialize in helping the Republican Party and conservative political groups However far they are from Gingrich the telemarketers are instructed to answer return calls with Republican Congressional Committee Newt Gingrich s office$77
 Rymer would have to pay her own way if the committee should actually meet and as an honorary committee chairman she discovered she would be a member of a committee composed entirely of honorary chairmen$77
 They are made by people with headsets and computers at the home of InfoCision Management Corp a telemarketing firm and Congressional committee client in Akron Ohio$77
 When she returned the call she said she was told she would also be named honorary chairman of an elite committee to advise Gingrich on legislation$77
 With the approach of the midterm elections next month it turns out that the National Republican Congressional Committee which supports candidates for the House has been sponsoring similar calls to tens of thousands of small business owners including doctors$77
 David Price and Julia Carson would have had little in common other than that they were Democrats with relatively safe seats$78
 I m pulling the Democratic ticket because I m tired of it the right side of the Republican Party is playing politics Daly said$78
 Largely as a result of the Lewinsky scandal Democrats say they suddenly fear that the Republicans will gain a filibuster proof seat majority in the Senate where the Republicans have seats to the Democrats $78
 Now that would be used on the nationwide media campaign that Newt has undertaken to target those seats we really need$78
 This is a very surreal environment Of the Senate seats in play are held by Democrats and by Republicans who now hold seats in all$78
 We fear that the Democratic Party faces irrelevance in the United States Senate if we go below seats Trying to avoid a rupture with D Amato Rivera praised him as an effective senator The endorsement could be a boon for Schumer$78
 Against that complicated backdrop the prevailing thinking is that the use of the impeachment issue will vary from race to race state to state and week to week depending on the circumstances of the candidates and the composition of the electorate$79
 All of which suggests that after the House voted Thursday to authorize an impeachment inquiry this year s races for the US Senate have become beyond what they already were the electoral equivalent of jury selection$79
 Because indeed we may be called upon to act as a jury of some kind But Schumer a member of the House Judiciary Committee which is conducting the impeachment investigation virtually embraced the issue$79
 For most of the strategists involved in the races there is little guidance on how to handle the impeachment issue$79
 Schumer s media adviser Hank Morris seemed to suggest last week that impeachment will grow as an issue$79
 The danger for Senate candidates is that with impeachment now a real possibility the debate may move beyond the president s behavior about which there is little disagreement to the more problematic issue of whether he should be removed from office$79

 The president left it to his aides on Friday to respond directly to the latest gusher of grand jury disclosures in Washington$80
 These fund raising visits have fallen into a pattern since Clinton s videotaped grand jury testimony on Aug$80
 If the House votes to impeach Clinton the matter goes to the Senate which must decide by a two thirds majority whether to convict him and thus remove him from office$81
 Instead they repeatedly asked him how he would vote on an impeachment of President Clinton$81
 Jennifer Duffy who follows Senate races for the Cook Political Report a nonpartisan newsletter said that so far at least none of the Senate candidates has made an explicit appeal for votes based on how they would vote on a presidential jury$81
 Republicans would have to win of the races to produce the votes necessary for conviction assuming such a vote were to go along party lines$81
 The decision Rivera emphasized repeatedly was not personal but was based on national considerations$81
 When a reporter asked about it many voters said that as appalled as they were at Clinton s behavior they had a hard time relating it to their decision on which way to vote in the congressional elections in five weeks$81
 As Hofmeister walked through the parking lot outside a gun and knife show at the Indiana National Guard Armory in Indianapolis last Sunday Billy Derringer a year old machinist who is retired on disability called him over to express outrage about the millions of dollars that had been spent to investigate Clinton$82
 Every word in the script is approved by our clients the company says on its Web site$82
 I was absolutely outraged he said$82
 On its Web page InfoCision says its employees operate telephone lines and phone centers$82
 They say they envisioned a senior aide at a telephone in the speaker s chambers under the Capitol Dome$82
 But some Democrats are close enough to Republican leaders and to Republican goals that their measures are taken seriously$83
 House leaders allowed the measure to be brought to the floor as a way to appease the more conservative members who believe they have been shortchanged by the budget process$83
 It s part of bringing them into the process$83
 John Murtha D Pa the ranking Democrat on the national security subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee who is pushing a measure to increase military pensions$83
 Shimkus measure is an example of how members of Congress are spending their time as they stand idle and wait for Republican leaders to reach agreement on spending bills with the White House thus avoiding a government shutdown and allowing them to go home and campaign for the November elections$83
